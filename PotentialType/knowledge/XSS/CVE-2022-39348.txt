User Input Sources:  
The function takes input from the `request` object, specifically the HTTP header `host`. This header can originate from the user making an HTTP request.

Main Functionality:  
The core purpose of the function `_getResourceForRequest` is to determine the appropriate resource to return based on the host specified in the HTTP request's host header. It checks if the host header is present; if not, it defaults to a pre-defined resource or a `NoResource` object. If the host header is present, it extracts and converts the host to lowercase, then attempts to retrieve the corresponding resource from a mapping (`self.hosts`). If the host is not found in the mapping, it defaults to a pre-defined resource or returns a `NoResource` object with a message indicating that the host is not in the virtual host map.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns a resource object. This could be a specific resource corresponding to the host if found in the mapping, a default resource if specified, or a `NoResource` object, which typically indicates that no suitable resource was found. The `NoResource` object may also contain a message explaining why the host was not found.
