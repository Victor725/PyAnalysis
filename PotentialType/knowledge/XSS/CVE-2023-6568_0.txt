The function is designed to handle user creation requests. It processes incoming requests to create a new user account, supporting both form data and JSON input formats. If the username is already taken, it provides a notification and redirects to the signup page. If the user is successfully created, it either redirects to the home page or returns a JSON response with user details, depending on the content type of the request.
