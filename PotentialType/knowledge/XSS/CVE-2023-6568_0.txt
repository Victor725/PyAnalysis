User Input Sources:  
- The function receives input from HTTP request headers and body. Specifically, it checks the "Content-Type" header and processes the request body accordingly. If the content type is "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", it extracts "username" and "password" from `request.form`. If the content type is "application/json", it extracts "username" and "password" using the `_get_request_param` function.

Main Functionality:  
- The function's core purpose is to create a new user account. It first determines the content type of the request to decide how to parse the input data. If the content type is "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", it checks if the username already exists using `store.has_user(username)`. If the username is available, it creates a new user with `store.create_user(username, password)`. If the content type is "application/json", it directly creates a user with the provided username and password. If the content type is neither, it returns an error message.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- If the content type is "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" and the username is already taken, it flashes an error message and returns an alert redirecting to the signup page (`SIGNUP`). If the user is successfully created, it flashes a success message and returns an alert redirecting to the home page (`HOME`).  
- If the content type is "application/json", it returns a JSON object containing the newly created user's data.  
- If the content type is invalid, it returns a plain text error message with a 400 status code.
