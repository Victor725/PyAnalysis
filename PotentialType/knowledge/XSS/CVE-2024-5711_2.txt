User Input Sources:  
The function takes input from an HTTP POST request with a JSON body. The user input specifically comes from the JSON object sent in the request, which is expected to contain a key "project_name".

Main Functionality:  
The core purpose of the function is to delete a project based on the provided project name. It retrieves the project name from the JSON data in the request, then calls the `delete_project` method of a `manager` object to perform the deletion. Additionally, it calls the `delete_state` method of an `AgentState` instance to remove the state associated with the project.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns a JSON response indicating the outcome of the operation. In this case, it returns a JSON object with a message stating "Project deleted".
