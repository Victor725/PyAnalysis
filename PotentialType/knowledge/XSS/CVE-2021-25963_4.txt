User Input Sources:  
The function takes input from the user via an HTTP POST request. It specifically looks for a parameter named "command" in the request's POST data. This input is provided by the user, typically through an HTTP request form submission or an API call.

Main Functionality:  
The core purpose of the function is to process a command received from a user's HTTP POST request. It extracts the "command" parameter from the request and attempts to handle it by calling the `handle_command` function with the request and command as arguments. If `handle_command` returns a valid response, the function returns this response. If the "command" parameter is missing or if `handle_command` does not return a valid response, the function raises a `Problem` exception with an error message indicating an unknown command.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns a `django.http.HttpResponse` object if the command is successfully handled by the `handle_command` function. If the command is not recognized or not handled properly, it raises an exception with an error message, which would typically result in an HTTP error response being sent back to the user.
