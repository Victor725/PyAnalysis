The function `_get_unauth_response` is designed to handle unauthorized access attempts in a web application. It generates an appropriate error response based on the nature of the request and the reason for the unauthorized access. If the request is made via AJAX, it returns a JSON response indicating the error. For non-AJAX requests, it constructs a URL for the login page, appending the error message as a query parameter, and redirects the user to this login page. If the user is already authenticated but still lacks access, it raises an exception with a detailed error message and a link for further action.
