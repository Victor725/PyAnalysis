The function generates an error response for unauthorized access based on the type of request and the authentication status of the user. If the request is an AJAX call, it returns a forbidden response with an error message. For other requests, it redirects to a login page with an error message. If the user is authenticated but lacks permissions, it raises an error with a link to a login page for using different credentials.
