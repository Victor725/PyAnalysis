User Input Sources:  
The function `_get_unauth_response` takes two inputs: `request` and `reason`. The `request` parameter is an `HttpRequest` object, which can originate from user interactions, such as HTTP request parameters or browser interactions. The `reason` parameter is a string that could also be influenced by user actions or system-generated conditions.

Main Functionality:  
The core purpose of the `_get_unauth_response` function is to handle unauthorized access attempts to a web resource. It generates an appropriate error response based on the type of request. If the request is an AJAX request, it returns a JSON response with an error message. For non-AJAX requests, it constructs a login URL with an error message and attempts to redirect the user to the login page. If the user is already authenticated but unauthorized to view the page, it raises a `Problem` exception with a helpful link to log in with different credentials.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- For AJAX requests: Returns an `HttpResponseForbidden` object containing a JSON string with an error message.
- For non-AJAX requests where the user is not authenticated: Returns a redirect response to the login page.
- For authenticated users who are unauthorized: Raises a `Problem` exception with a message and a link to the login page.
