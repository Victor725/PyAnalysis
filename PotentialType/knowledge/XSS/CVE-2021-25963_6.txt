User Input Sources:  
- The function takes a `request` parameter, which is an instance of `django.http.HttpRequest`. This can include user input from HTTP request parameters, such as query strings, form data, cookies, and headers.
- The `view` parameter is a string that represents the view name. This could potentially be derived from user input if the function is called with user-provided data.

Main Functionality:  
- The function's primary purpose is to dispatch a request to a specific view within a theme in the context of a Django web application using the Xtheme framework.
- It retrieves the current theme using either an attribute from the request object or by calling `get_current_theme` with the shop attribute from the request.
- It attempts to find a view function associated with the given view name and the current theme using `get_view_by_name`.
- If the view function is not found, it returns an HTTP 404 response with an error message indicating the theme identifier and the view name.
- If the view function is found, it invokes this function with the request object.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function returns an instance of `django.http.HttpResponse`. If the view is found, it returns whatever response is generated by the view function. If the view is not found, it returns an `HttpResponseNotFound` with an error message.
