The function `extra_view_dispatch` is designed to handle and route a web request to a specific view associated with a theme in a Django application. It first determines the current theme, either from the request or by retrieving it based on the shop associated with the request. It then attempts to locate a view function corresponding to the specified view name within that theme. If the view function is not found, it returns a "not found" HTTP response. Otherwise, it invokes the view function with the request and returns the resulting HTTP response.
