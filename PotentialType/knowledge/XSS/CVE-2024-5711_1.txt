User Input Sources:  
The function takes input from an HTTP POST request with JSON data. The user provides input through a JSON object, specifically by supplying a "project_name" key within the JSON payload.

Main Functionality:  
The core purpose of the function is to create a new project. It extracts the "project_name" from the JSON data sent in the HTTP request and uses this name to call the `create_project` method of a `manager` object, which presumably handles the logic for creating a project.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns a JSON response with a message indicating the successful creation of the project. The response has the format: `{"message": "Project created"}`.
