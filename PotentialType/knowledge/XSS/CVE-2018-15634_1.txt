The function is designed to handle file uploads in a web application. It processes incoming files from an HTTP request, specifically targeting attachments related to a particular model and record in a database. The function iterates over each file, normalizes the filename if the browser is Safari to ensure proper character encoding, and attempts to create a new attachment record in the database. If the creation is successful, it gathers metadata about the file, such as its filename, MIME type, ID, and size. In case of an error during the file upload or database operation, it logs the exception and returns an error message. The function ultimately returns a JavaScript snippet to trigger a client-side event with the upload results or a JSON response containing the results, depending on whether a callback is provided.
