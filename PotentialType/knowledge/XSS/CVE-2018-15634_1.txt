User Input Sources:  
The function takes input from HTTP request parameters. Specifically, it receives input through the `model`, `id`, and `ufile` parameters. The `ufile` parameter is expected to be a file uploaded by the user, accessible via `request.httprequest.files.getlist('ufile')`. The `model` and `id` parameters are also user-provided, likely through URL query parameters or form data.

Main Functionality:  
The core purpose of the function is to handle the upload of files as attachments to a specified model and record in a web application. It processes each uploaded file, normalizes the filename if the request comes from a Safari browser, and creates a new record in the `ir.attachment` model with the file data. The file content is encoded in base64 before being stored. If an error occurs during the creation of the attachment, it logs the exception and adds an error message to the response.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns a JavaScript snippet or a JSON object. If a `callback` parameter is provided, it returns a JavaScript snippet that triggers a jQuery event in the top window with the callback and response data as arguments. If no callback is provided, it simply returns a JSON array containing the results of the file upload operations, including error messages or success details for each file. The response includes details like the filename, MIME type, attachment ID, and file size for successful uploads.
