User Input Sources:  
The function `get_current_phase` takes a parameter named `requested_phase_identifier`. This parameter could potentially originate from user input, such as HTTP request parameters or command-line arguments, depending on how the function is called within the application.

Main Functionality:  
The function's primary purpose is to determine and return the current phase from a sequence of phases. It iterates over a collection of `phases`, each of which is expected to have methods `is_valid()`, `process()`, `should_skip()`, and an attribute `identifier`. The function processes each valid phase, checks if the phase matches the `requested_phase_identifier`, and determines if it should return the current phase based on certain conditions. If a phase is not valid and should not be skipped, it is considered the current phase. If no matching phase is found, an HTTP 404 error is raised, indicating that the requested phase identifier was not found.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns an object representing the current phase, which is an element from the `phases` collection. If no appropriate phase is found, it raises an `Http404` exception with an error message, which typically results in a 404 HTTP response in a web application context.
