The method's purpose is to retrieve a specific phase from a sequence of phases, identified by a given identifier. It iterates through the phases, processing each valid phase. The method returns the current phase if it matches the requested identifier or if a previous phase is invalid and should not be skipped. If no matching phase is found, it raises an HTTP 404 error indicating the phase was not found.
