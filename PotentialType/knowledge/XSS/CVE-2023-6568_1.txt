The function is designed to handle requests for searching datasets associated with specified experiment IDs. It validates the input to ensure at least one and no more than a specified maximum number of experiment IDs are provided. It then interacts with a data store to retrieve dataset summaries, if the store supports this operation. If the operation is not supported, it returns a not implemented response.
