The function is designed to handle requests for searching datasets associated with specified experiment IDs. It validates the input to ensure that at least one experiment ID is provided and that the number of experiment IDs does not exceed a predefined limit. If the validation passes, it attempts to retrieve dataset summaries from a tracking store, provided the store supports the search operation. If the operation is not supported, it returns a response indicating that the functionality is not implemented.
