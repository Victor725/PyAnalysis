User Input Sources:  
The function `search_datasets_handler` receives input from the user via an HTTP request. Specifically, it accesses the `experiment_ids` from the JSON body of the request using `request.json.get("experiment_ids", [])`.

Main Functionality:  
The primary purpose of the `search_datasets_handler` function is to handle search requests for datasets based on experiment IDs. It first checks if the `experiment_ids` list is provided and ensures it contains at least one ID. If not, it raises an `MlflowException` with an appropriate error message. Additionally, it enforces a limit on the number of experiment IDs that can be processed per request, raising an exception if this limit is exceeded. If the conditions are satisfied, it interacts with a tracking store to search for datasets using the provided experiment IDs. If the tracking store has a `_search_datasets` method, it calls this method and converts the resulting dataset summaries into dictionaries.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns a dictionary containing a list of dataset summaries if the search operation is successful. Each dataset summary is converted into a dictionary format. If the tracking store does not support the search operation, the function returns the result of `_not_implemented()`, which likely indicates that the feature is not available.
