The function `search_datasets_handler` processes a request to search for datasets associated with specified experiment IDs. It enforces constraints on the number of experiment IDs allowed per request and retrieves dataset summaries if the underlying storage system supports the operation. If the operation is unsupported, it returns a not-implemented response.
