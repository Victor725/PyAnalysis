User Input Sources:  
- The function takes input from HTTP POST request parameters. Specifically, it looks for parameters named "command", "save", and "publish", as well as any other parameters included in the POST request.

Main Functionality:  
- The primary purpose of the function is to handle POST requests in a web application context. It checks for a "command" parameter in the POST request and dynamically calls a method on the class corresponding to that command, if such a method exists. If the method is not callable, it raises an error. The function also processes form data if the "save" parameter is present and the form is valid, saving the form and layout data. If the "publish" parameter is set to "1", it calls a method to handle publishing. Additionally, it can rebuild the form and change the request method to "GET" to facilitate re-rendering with updated data.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function can return various outputs depending on the conditions met during execution:
  - It may return the result of the dynamically dispatched method if the "command" parameter is provided and a corresponding method is successfully called.
  - It may return the result of the `dispatch_publish` method if the "publish" parameter is "1".
  - It defaults to returning the result of the `get` method from its superclass, which typically would render an HTML page with the current state of the form and data.
