This function is a web view that handles POST requests to generate and display a list of credits for translations. It checks user permissions and validates input data from a form to filter and format translation credit information based on project and component parameters. The output can be formatted as either JSON or HTML/plain text, depending on the user's selection, and is returned in an HTTP response.
