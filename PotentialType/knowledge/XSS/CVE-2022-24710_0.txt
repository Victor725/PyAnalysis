User Input Sources:  
- The function takes input from the `request` object, specifically `request.POST`, which can include data from HTTP POST request parameters.  
- It also uses `request.user` to determine permissions and potentially adjust the data generation logic based on user permissions.  
- Optional URL parameters `project` and `component` are used to determine the scope of the data being processed.

Main Functionality:  
- The function is a Django view that generates and returns credits for translations.  
- It uses the `ReportsForm` to validate input data from the request.  
- Based on the validity of the form, it either shows form errors and redirects the user or proceeds to generate credits data.  
- The credits data generation depends on the user's permissions and the provided `project` and `component` parameters.  
- The generated credits data is formatted either as JSON or HTML/plain text based on the user's choice specified in the form.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- If the form is invalid, the function redirects to a specified URL with form errors shown.  
- If the form is valid, it returns a JSON response if the user selected the "json" style.  
- For "html" style, it returns an HTML table with the credits information.  
- For any other style, it returns plain text with the credits information.  
- The response content type is set accordingly to either "application/json", "text/html", or "text/plain".
