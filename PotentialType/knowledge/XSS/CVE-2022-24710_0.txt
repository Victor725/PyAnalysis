The function is a web view designed to generate and return a report of credits for translations within a specified project and component. It requires the user to be logged in and only accepts POST requests. Depending on the parameters provided, it identifies the relevant project or component. It validates the submitted form data and, if invalid, redirects the user while displaying errors. If the form is valid, it generates credits data based on user permissions and specified date ranges. The output format of the report can be either JSON or a formatted table, which is returned as an HTTP response.
