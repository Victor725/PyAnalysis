User Input Sources:  
- The function takes `fields` as an input parameter, which is expected to be a list of field names. This could potentially originate from user input, especially if the method is part of a web API or a system where users can specify which fields they are interested in.
- The function also accesses `self._context`, which might contain user-specific context data, potentially influenced by user actions or input.

Main Functionality:  
- The method `default_get` is designed to provide default values for fields when creating or editing a record in a model. It extends the default functionality of `default_get` by adding additional logic specific to the `Invite` class.
- It retrieves the current user's name and attempts to construct a personalized message inviting another user to follow a document.
- If the context contains the key `mail_invite_follower_channel_only`, it sets the `send_mail` field to `False`, presumably to control whether an invitation email should be sent.
- If the `fields` list includes the field `message`, and if both `model` and `res_id` are present in the result, it generates a detailed invitation message including the model and document names. Otherwise, it provides a generic invitation message.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function returns a dictionary (`result`) that includes default values for the specified fields. This dictionary may contain a personalized `message` string, and potentially a `send_mail` flag set to `False`, depending on the context and input conditions.
