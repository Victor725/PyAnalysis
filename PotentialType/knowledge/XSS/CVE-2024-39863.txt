User Input Sources:  
The function does not directly take any input from the user. However, it is exposed through a web route `/plugin`, which means it can be triggered by an HTTP request to this endpoint. The function does not utilize any request parameters, command-line arguments, environment variables, or file contents directly within its logic.

Main Functionality:  
The function is designed to list the currently loaded plugins in an Airflow environment. It ensures that all plugins are loaded and initialized by calling several methods on the `plugins_manager`. It then iterates over the loaded plugins, collecting specific attributes defined in `self.plugins_attributes_to_dump` for each plugin. This information is compiled into a list of dictionaries, each representing a plugin and its attributes.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns an HTML page that displays the list of loaded plugins. It uses a template called `airflow/plugin.html` and passes the compiled list of plugins, a title ("Airflow Plugins"), and a documentation URL to this template for rendering.
