The function is designed to list and display information about loaded plugins in a web interface. It first ensures that all necessary plugins are loaded and integrated, including any additional operators, executors, and web UI components. It then gathers relevant attributes of each plugin to prepare a structured list of plugin data. Finally, it renders this information into an HTML template, providing users with a view of available plugins, complete with documentation links.
