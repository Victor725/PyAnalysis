The function is designed to handle HTTP requests to a specific endpoint. It checks if the request path starts with a particular pattern and, if so, redirects the request to a new URL format using both an HTML meta tag and JavaScript for immediate redirection. If the pattern does not match, it raises an HTTP redirect to a default URL.
