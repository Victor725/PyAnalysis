User Input Sources:  
The function takes user input through the `rest` parameter, which is part of the URL path specified by the user when accessing the `/browse/{+rest=""}` endpoint. This input is directly used in the function logic to determine the action taken.

Main Functionality:  
The primary purpose of the `browse` function is to handle URL redirection for a web server. Specifically, it checks if the `rest` parameter starts with 'book/'. If so, it constructs a new URL by appending a fragment identifier that includes the book ID and a panel identifier to the base URL. It then returns an HTML page with a meta refresh tag and a JavaScript script to redirect the user's browser to this new URL immediately. If the `rest` parameter does not start with 'book/', the function raises an HTTPRedirect to redirect the user to a default URL.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns an HTML page that includes a meta refresh tag and a JavaScript script for client-side redirection. The HTML page is constructed using the `lxml.etree` library to ensure proper XML structure. If the `rest` parameter does not match the expected pattern, it results in an HTTP redirect to a default location.
