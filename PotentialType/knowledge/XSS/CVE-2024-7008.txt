The function is designed to handle requests to a specific endpoint. It examines the request path to determine if it begins with a certain prefix. If the prefix is present, it constructs a new URL to redirect the user to a different page, ensuring compatibility with updated URL formats. The redirection is implemented using both an HTML meta tag and a JavaScript script for immediate navigation. If the prefix is not present, it raises an HTTP redirect to a default location. Overall, the function's role is to manage URL redirection for outdated server paths to ensure users are directed to the correct, updated resources.
