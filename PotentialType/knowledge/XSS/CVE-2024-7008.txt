This function is designed to handle URL requests and redirect them appropriately. It checks if the URL path corresponds to a specific format related to book details and, if so, constructs a new URL and performs a redirect to this updated URL using both meta-refresh and JavaScript methods. If the URL path does not match the expected format, it performs a general redirect to a base URL.
