User Input Sources:  
The function takes user input from HTTP request parameters. Specifically, it retrieves the value of "project_name" from the query string of a GET request using `request.args.get("project_name")`.

Main Functionality:  
The core purpose of the function is to retrieve a list of files associated with a specified project. It uses the `project_name` obtained from the user's input to call `AgentState.get_project_files(project_name)`, which presumably interacts with some data source or service to fetch the relevant file information.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns a JSON object containing the list of files associated with the project name provided by the user. The JSON object is structured as `{"files": files}`, where `files` is the list of files retrieved by the `AgentState.get_project_files` method.
