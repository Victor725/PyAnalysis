The function is designed to handle file uploads via an HTTP route. It processes the uploaded file, encodes its data, and then returns a JavaScript snippet that triggers a client-side event with information about the file, such as its size, name, and content type. If an error occurs during processing, it returns the error message instead. Optionally, it can execute a callback function with the file information.
