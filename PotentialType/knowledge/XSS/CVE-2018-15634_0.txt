User Input Sources:  
- The function takes input from the user via an HTTP request, specifically through the file upload mechanism. The `ufile` parameter is expected to be a file object uploaded by the user. Additionally, there is an optional `callback` parameter that can also originate from user input as part of the HTTP request.

Main Functionality:  
- The primary purpose of the function is to handle file uploads via an HTTP route (`/web/binary/upload`). It reads the uploaded file's data, encodes it in base64, and prepares a JavaScript snippet that triggers a jQuery event in the browser window. The event passes details about the file, including its size, filename, content type, and encoded data. If an exception occurs during file reading, it captures the exception and prepares an error message instead.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function returns a JavaScript snippet as a string, which is intended to be executed in the client's browser. This snippet either triggers an event with the file's details or an error message, depending on whether the file was successfully read or an exception occurred. If a `callback` is provided, it is included in the event trigger.
