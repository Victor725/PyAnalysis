The function `create_promptlab_run_handler` is designed to handle the creation of a new "Promptlab" run within an MLflow context. It first validates the presence of necessary arguments from a JSON request, ensuring that critical fields like experiment ID, prompt template, and model route are specified. It then constructs parameter objects for various components such as prompt parameters, model parameters, and model output parameters. The function interacts with a tracking store to create a run using these parameters and other optional inputs like run name, tags, and start time. Finally, it returns a JSON response containing the details of the created run. The function is decorated with mechanisms to catch MLflow-specific exceptions and to potentially disable certain operations if only artifact-related tasks are involved.
