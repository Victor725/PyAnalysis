User Input Sources:  
- The function takes user input from `request.form`, which typically contains data submitted via an HTTP POST request. The specific fields accessed are:
  - `draw`: A parameter used for DataTables to indicate the draw count.
  - `search[value]`: A search text input for filtering data.
  - `start`: Indicates the starting point for data retrieval (used for pagination).
  - `length`: Specifies the number of records to retrieve (also for pagination).
  - `order[i][column]` and `order[i][dir]`: Used for sorting columns, where `i` is an index.
  - `columns[i][search][value]` and `columns[i][name]`: Used for column-specific search filters, where `i` is an index.

Main Functionality:  
- The function's core purpose is to handle an AJAX request for fetching and filtering data from a datastore, typically used in conjunction with a DataTables interface. It retrieves a resource view based on `resource_view_id` and applies search and filter criteria derived from the user input. It constructs a query to fetch filtered and sorted data from the datastore, accounting for both global search terms and column-specific filters. Additionally, it handles pagination by using the `offset` and `limit` parameters. The function also processes sorting orders specified by the user.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function returns a JSON object that contains:
  - `draw`: The draw count from the request, used for synchronization in DataTables.
  - `recordsTotal`: Total number of records available before filtering.
  - `recordsFiltered`: Number of records after applying the filters.
  - `data`: A list of dictionaries representing the records fetched from the datastore, with each record containing column data and a unique row ID (`DT_RowId`).
  - In case of an error during the search query, it returns a JSON object with an `error` field describing the issue.
