The function `ajax` is designed to handle a server-side request for data retrieval and processing, specifically in the context of a web application that interfaces with a data store. Its primary role is to process and respond to an AJAX request by performing the following tasks:

1. **Resource Retrieval**: It retrieves metadata about a specific resource view using its identifier.

2. **Request Parameter Extraction**: It extracts various parameters from the incoming request, such as pagination details, search criteria, and sorting preferences.

3. **Filter Merging**: It combines predefined view filters with user-provided filters to form a comprehensive filter set for querying the data store.

4. **Data Store Querying**: It queries the data store to fetch records based on search criteria, filters, and sorting preferences. It first performs an unfiltered query to get metadata like available fields, and then a filtered query to get the actual data records.

5. **Column and Search Handling**: It processes search inputs and column-specific search values, adapting them for full-text search capabilities.

6. **Response Construction**: It constructs a JSON response containing data records, along with metadata such as total records and filtered record counts. It also handles exceptions by providing an error message in the response if the query fails.

Overall, this function facilitates dynamic data retrieval and presentation in a tabular format, supporting features like searching, sorting, and pagination, which are common in data-driven web applications.
