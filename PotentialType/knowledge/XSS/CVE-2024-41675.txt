The function is designed to handle an AJAX request for retrieving and processing data from a datastore. It extracts parameters from the request to define search criteria, filters, sorting options, and pagination settings. It then queries the datastore based on these parameters, processes the results to format them for DataTables, and returns the formatted data as a JSON response. If an error occurs during the query, it returns an error message instead.
