The function processes an AJAX request to retrieve and filter data from a datastore. It extracts and processes request parameters for pagination, sorting, and searching, applies user and view-specific filters, and performs a search query on the datastore. The results are formatted into a JSON object that includes metadata for DataTables, such as the draw count, total records, filtered records, and the data itself, which is returned as the response.
