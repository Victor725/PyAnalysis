This function handles user signup requests on a web application. It first checks whether the signup is allowed and if a token is present. If a POST request is received without errors, it attempts to create a new user account and send a confirmation email if a token is available. In case of exceptions during signup, it logs errors and updates the context with error messages. Finally, it renders a signup page with the relevant context and includes security headers in the response.
