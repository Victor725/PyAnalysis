The function `web_auth_signup` is designed to handle user sign-up requests for a web application. It first checks if sign-ups are enabled and if a token is provided; if not, it returns a not found error. If the request method is POST and there are no existing errors, it attempts to create a new user account. Upon successful account creation, it sends a confirmation email if a token is present. If any errors occur during the sign-up process, it logs the error and updates the context with an appropriate error message. Finally, it renders the sign-up page with the current context and sets a security header to prevent clickjacking.
