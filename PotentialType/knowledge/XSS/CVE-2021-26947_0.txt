The function handles user signup requests on a web application. It checks if account signup is enabled or a valid token is provided. If a POST request is made without errors, it attempts to create a new user account and sends a confirmation email if a token is present. If successful, it redirects the user to the login page. In case of errors during signup, it records appropriate error messages. Finally, it renders the signup page with security headers to prevent clickjacking.
