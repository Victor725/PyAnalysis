This function handles HTTP GET requests by retrieving and returning the contents of a file specified by a given path. It first determines the root directory for the file based on a component registry. If the file or component is not found, it returns a 404 error. If the file is successfully read, it sends the file's contents back to the requester with the appropriate content type and additional headers.
