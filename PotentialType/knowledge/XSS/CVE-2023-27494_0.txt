This function handles HTTP GET requests for retrieving files associated with a specific component. It extracts the component name and file path from the provided path, checks if the component exists, and constructs the absolute file path. If the file is successfully read, it writes the file's contents to the response, sets the appropriate content type header, and applies any additional headers. If the component or file is not found, or if an error occurs while reading the file, it responds with a 404 status and an error message.
