User Input Sources:  
- The function can take user input through the `command` parameter, which is a string representing the command to be executed.  
- The `kwargs` parameter, if not provided, defaults to the contents of `self.request.POST`, which typically includes data sent by the user in an HTTP POST request.  
- The function accesses `self.request` and `self.basket`, indicating potential user-specific data or session information.

Main Functionality:  
- The function's core purpose is to process a given command by dispatching it to an appropriate handler method.  
- It retrieves a command handler using `self.get_command_handler(command)`. If the handler is not valid or callable, it raises a `Problem` exception.  
- It sanitizes `kwargs` by removing specific keys such as "csrfmiddlewaretoken" and "command".  
- It updates `kwargs` with additional context information such as `request` and `basket`.  
- It preprocesses `kwargs` using the `preprocess_kwargs` method and then calls the handler with the prepared arguments.  
- If an exception occurs during processing, it captures the exception and creates an error response.  
- The function post-processes the response using `postprocess_response`.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- If the request is made via AJAX, the function returns a `JsonResponse` containing the command's result or error information.  
- If a non-AJAX request is made, the function attempts to redirect the user. It checks for a "return" URL in the response or `kwargs`.  
- If a valid "return" URL is found, it returns an `HttpResponseRedirect` to that URL.  
- If no valid return URL is found, it defaults to redirecting to the "shuup:basket" view.
