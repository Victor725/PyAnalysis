The function is designed to handle the processing of a specified command by dispatching it to an appropriate command handler. It begins by determining the arguments to use, either from provided arguments or from a request's POST data. The function attempts to retrieve and validate a command handler for the given command. It ensures that sensitive data, like CSRF tokens, are not included in the arguments passed to the handler. The function preprocesses the arguments, executes the command handler, and processes any exceptions that occur during execution, particularly for AJAX requests. After handling the command, it post-processes the response and determines the appropriate HTTP response to return, either as a JSON response for AJAX requests or a redirection based on the response content.
