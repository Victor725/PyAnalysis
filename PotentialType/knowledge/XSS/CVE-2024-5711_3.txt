User Input Sources:  
- The function takes user input from HTTP GET request parameters, specifically the `project_name` parameter, which is accessed through `request.args.get("project_name")`.

Main Functionality:  
- The primary purpose of the function is to handle a request to download a project. It retrieves the project name from the query parameters of the HTTP request. It then calls `manager.project_to_zip(project_name)` to create a ZIP archive of the specified project. After that, it obtains the path to the created ZIP file using `manager.get_zip_path(project_name)`.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function returns the ZIP file associated with the project as a response. The `send_file` function is used to send the file to the client, allowing it to be downloaded. The `as_attachment=False` parameter indicates that the file will be served inline rather than as an attachment, meaning it might be displayed in the browser instead of being downloaded directly.
