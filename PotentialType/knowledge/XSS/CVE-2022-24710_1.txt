The function `get_counts` is a web view designed to handle POST requests for retrieving and displaying work-related counts. It requires user authentication and is intended to be used within a web application framework, likely Django, given the use of decorators such as `@login_required` and `@require_POST`.

### Purpose and Behavior:
- **Access Control**: The function ensures that only authenticated users can access it.
- **Data Retrieval**: It fetches specific work-related data, such as counts of total and new edits, word and character counts, and similar metrics.
- **Input Handling**: It uses a form to validate the input data from the request. If the form is invalid, it redirects the user to a specified page with form errors displayed.
- **Permission Check**: It checks whether the user has permission to view certain reports and adjusts the data retrieval accordingly.
- **Data Presentation**: The function formats the retrieved data based on the user's preferred style (either JSON, HTML, or plain text) and returns it in the appropriate format. JSON responses are returned using `JsonResponse`, while HTML and plain text responses are constructed manually and returned using `HttpResponse`.
- **Output**: The function generates a structured output with headers and data rows formatted according to the specified style, ensuring that the data is presented in a user-friendly manner.

Overall, `get_counts` is responsible for securely handling requests to generate and display formatted work count reports based on user input and permissions.
