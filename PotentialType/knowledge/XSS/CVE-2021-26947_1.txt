The function is responsible for handling the login process for a web application. It manages both GET and POST HTTP requests to facilitate user authentication. On a GET request, if a user is already authenticated and a redirect URL is provided, it redirects the user to the specified URL. On a POST request, it attempts to authenticate the user using provided credentials. If authentication is successful, the user is redirected to a specific page. If authentication fails, an appropriate error message is set. Additionally, the function manages session parameters, handles database access permissions, and ensures that the web page is protected against clickjacking by setting specific HTTP headers.
