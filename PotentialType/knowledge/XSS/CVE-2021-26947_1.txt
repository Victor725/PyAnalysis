User Input Sources:  
- The function takes input from HTTP request parameters, which may include 'login', 'password', 'redirect', and potentially others through the `**kw` argument.
- The function checks the HTTP request method (GET or POST) to determine its behavior.
- The `redirect` parameter can also be influenced by user input.
- The function accesses session variables, such as `request.session.uid` and `request.session.db`.

Main Functionality:  
- The function handles user login requests to a web application. It supports both GET and POST HTTP methods.
- For a GET request, if the user is already authenticated (`request.session.uid` exists) and a `redirect` URL is provided, it redirects the user to the specified URL.
- For a POST request, it attempts to authenticate the user with the provided 'login' and 'password'. If successful, it redirects the user to a post-login page. If authentication fails, it sets an error message.
- It checks and lists available databases, handling access denial exceptions.
- The function also manages error messages related to access restrictions and login failures.
- It sets security-related HTTP headers to prevent clickjacking.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- On successful login, it redirects the user to a specified or default URL.
- On failed login, it returns an error message within a rendered HTML page.
- The final output is an HTML page, either the login form or a redirect response, with appropriate HTTP headers set.
