This function handles the web login process for a web application. It supports both GET and POST requests to manage user authentication. On a GET request, it checks if a user is already logged in and redirects them if a redirect URL is provided. On a POST request, it attempts to authenticate the user with provided credentials, setting appropriate error messages if authentication fails. The function also prepares the necessary data for rendering the login page, including handling database availability and session management, and sets security-related HTTP headers in the response.
