User Input Sources:  
The function `_not_here_yet` takes a `request` object as its primary input source, which is typically associated with HTTP requests in a web application context. The `request` object can contain data originating from the user, such as URL paths, query parameters, and other HTTP request metadata. Additionally, the function accepts variable positional (`*args`) and keyword arguments (`**kwargs`), which could also be populated with user-provided data if they are used in the application routing or view logic.

Main Functionality:  
The core purpose of the `_not_here_yet` function is to generate an HTTP response indicating that a certain resource or functionality is not yet available. It constructs a message using the request's path and any additional positional and keyword arguments provided, and it returns this message with an HTTP status code of 410 (Gone). This status code is used to indicate that the resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns an `HttpResponse` object containing a plain text message that includes the request path and the representations of any additional arguments. The response is accompanied by an HTTP status code of 410, which is typically used to signal that the requested resource is permanently gone.
