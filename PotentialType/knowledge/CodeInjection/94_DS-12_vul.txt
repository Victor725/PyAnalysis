The function `admin_actions` is designed to handle HTTP GET requests to the '/admin/actions' endpoint. It first checks for an authorization token in the request parameters to verify if the requester is authorized. If the token is not valid, it responds with an error message and a 403 status code. If authorized, it retrieves an action command from the request parameters and executes it, returning the result in a JSON response.
