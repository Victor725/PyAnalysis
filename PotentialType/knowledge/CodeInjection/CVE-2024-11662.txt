The function `deploy_host_vars` is a web API endpoint designed to manage host variables associated with a specific asset, identified by an ID. It supports both GET and POST HTTP methods. 

- For a GET request, the function retrieves the host variables for the specified asset. If the asset is found and has host variables, it attempts to evaluate and return them in a JSON response. If the asset is not found, it returns a 404 error. If there is an error in evaluating the host variables, it returns an error message.

- For a POST request, the function updates the host variables for the specified asset. It attempts to evaluate and serialize the provided host variables, then saves them to the asset. If successful, it returns a success message with the updated host variables. If there is an error during the evaluation or serialization, it returns an error message.

Note: The use of `eval` poses a significant security risk as it can execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to vulnerabilities.
