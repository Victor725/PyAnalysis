This function generates a report based on a specified type and custom logic provided by the user. It retrieves a template for the report, executes the custom logic within the current global and local scope, and then evaluates the template string to produce the final report. The function is vulnerable to code injection attacks due to the use of `exec` and `eval` with untrusted input. If an error occurs during the process, it returns an error message indicating the failure of report generation.
