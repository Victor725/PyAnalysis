This function handles the HTTP POST request for updating a user's information. It retrieves a user by a primary key, processes the form data from the request, and checks the form's validity. If the form is valid, it saves the updated user data and redirects to a user list page, displaying a success message. If the form is invalid, it returns to the user detail page with an error message, allowing for correction and resubmission of the form.
