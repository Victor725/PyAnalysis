User Input Sources:  
- The function takes input from the user via `request.POST`, which contains data submitted by the user through an HTTP POST request. This data is used to populate the `UserForm`.

Main Functionality:  
- The function's primary purpose is to handle the updating of a user's information. It retrieves a user object based on the primary key (`pk`) and initializes a form (`UserForm`) with the submitted POST data and the existing user instance. It then checks if the form data is valid. If valid, it saves the updated user information to the database and displays a success message. If the form is not valid, it shows an error message and renders a template to allow the user to correct the form.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- If the form submission is successful, the function redirects the user to the "admin_user_list" page using `HttpResponseRedirect`.  
- If the form submission is unsuccessful (i.e., invalid data), it returns an HTML page rendered with the template "my_admin/user_detail.html", along with the form and user context for error correction.
