This function serves as a web API endpoint that processes POST requests to evaluate mathematical expressions provided in the request body. It attempts to safely compute the result of the expression using restricted access to certain libraries and returns the result in JSON format. If the input is invalid or an error occurs during evaluation, it responds with an error message. However, the use of `eval` poses a security risk, as it can potentially execute arbitrary code.
