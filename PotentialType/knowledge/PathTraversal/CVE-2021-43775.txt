User Input Sources:  
The function takes user input from an HTTP GET request parameter. Specifically, it extracts the 'path' parameter from the URL, which is part of the route defined as '/static-files/{path:path}/'. This parameter is provided by the user in the URL path.

Main Functionality:  
The core purpose of the function is to serve static files from a specific directory on the server. It constructs the path to the static file based on the user-provided 'path' parameter. It checks if a compressed version of the file (with a '.gz' extension) exists. If the compressed file is available, it serves that file with a 'Content-Encoding' header set to 'gzip'. If the compressed version is not available, it serves the original static file.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns a `FileResponse` object, which is used to send the contents of a file to the client. Depending on the existence of the compressed file, it either returns the compressed file or the original static file. The response includes the file content and, if applicable, a header indicating that the content is gzip-compressed.
