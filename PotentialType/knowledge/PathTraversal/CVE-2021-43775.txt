This function is an asynchronous endpoint handler for serving static files in a web application. It constructs the file path based on the requested path and checks if a compressed version of the file exists. If the compressed file is present, it serves the compressed file with the appropriate content encoding header. Otherwise, it serves the uncompressed version of the file.
