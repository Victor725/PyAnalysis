The `put` method is designed to handle the uploading of a new file to a server. It processes file data submitted via a multipart form or a JSON payload, checks for the existence of a file with the same name, and manages file uploads from URLs. The method ensures the file is appropriately stored and extracted if it's an archive, while also enforcing constraints such as file size limits for URL-sourced files. Upon successful processing, it saves the file using a file controller and cleans up temporary resources, returning a success status.
