User Input Sources:
- The function receives user input from an HTTP request. It can handle both `multipart/form-data` and JSON content types.
- In `multipart/form-data`, user inputs include form fields and file uploads, which are processed using a form parser.
- For JSON, the input is expected to be a JSON object received from the request body.
- The function also handles a URL provided by the user when the `source_type` is specified as 'url' in the input data.

Main Functionality:
- The function's primary purpose is to handle file uploads and storage. It can process files sent directly via a form or download them from a specified URL.
- It checks if a file with the given name already exists, returning an error if so.
- For URL-based uploads, it verifies the file size if certain conditions are met (e.g., if the application is running in the cloud and the user is not a privileged user).
- The function supports extracting single files from `.zip` or `.tar.gz` archives.
- It ensures that the archive contains only one data file and that the file is correctly placed.
- After processing, it saves the file using a file controller and cleans up temporary directories.

Outputs / Return Values:
- The function returns an HTTP response. It returns an empty string with a status code of `200` on successful file upload and processing.
- If errors occur, such as file existence conflicts, file size issues, or invalid archive contents, it returns an HTTP error response with a status code `400` and an appropriate error message.
