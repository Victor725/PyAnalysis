This function handles HTTP requests to return an image file associated with a specific camera. It verifies the user's login status, retrieves the camera based on a unique identifier, determines the appropriate directory path based on the image type (still or timelapse), checks for the existence of the requested image file, and sends the image file to the client if found. If the image type is unknown or the file is not found, it returns an error message.
