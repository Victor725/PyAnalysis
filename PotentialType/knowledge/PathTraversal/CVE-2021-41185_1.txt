User Input Sources:  
The function `camera_img_return_path` takes user input from the URL parameters. Specifically, it receives `camera_unique_id`, `img_type`, and `filename` as parts of the URL path. These inputs can originate from a user's HTTP request to the server.

Main Functionality:  
The core purpose of the function is to serve image files from a camera's directory. It checks the type of image requested (`still` or `timelapse`) and retrieves the corresponding path for the camera identified by `camera_unique_id`. The function verifies the existence of the specified image file (`filename`) in the determined directory and returns the image if found. If the image type is unknown or the file does not exist, it returns an appropriate error message.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- If the image type is not recognized, it returns the plain text message "Unknown Image Type".
- If the specified image file is found, it returns the image file with the MIME type set to 'image/jpeg' using Flask's `send_file` function.
- If the image file is not found, it returns the plain text message "Image not found".
