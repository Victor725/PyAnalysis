This function handles HTTP GET requests for components in a system. It extracts the component name and file path from the request path, retrieves the component's root directory from a registry, and attempts to construct an absolute file path. If the component or file is not found, it responds with a "not found" message and a 404 status. If the file is found, it reads the file's contents and writes them to the response, setting the appropriate content type header. Additionally, it logs any errors encountered during the file reading process and sets extra headers for the response.
