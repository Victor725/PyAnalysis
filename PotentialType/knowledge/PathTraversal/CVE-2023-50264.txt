User Input Sources:  
- The function takes user input through the URL path parameter `<path:filename>`. This parameter is extracted from the HTTP GET request made to the endpoint `/system/backup/download/<path:filename>`.

Main Functionality:  
- The function's primary purpose is to handle HTTP GET requests to download backup files from the server. It constructs a file path by combining a predefined backup folder path from `settings.backup.folder` with the `filename` provided by the user. The function then serves this file to the user as an attachment, effectively initiating a file download.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function returns the specified file as an HTTP response. The file is served with the `Content-Disposition` header set to trigger a download (`as_attachment=True`). The response includes the file contents, allowing the user to download the file to their local system. The `max_age=0` parameter is used to ensure the file is not cached by the browser.
