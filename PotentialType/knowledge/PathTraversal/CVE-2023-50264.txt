This function is a web route handler responsible for serving backup files to authenticated users. When accessed via a GET request, it delivers a specified file from a backup directory for download. The function ensures that the file is sent as an attachment, preventing it from being displayed directly in the browser. Additionally, it enforces no caching for the file being downloaded. The function is protected by an authentication check to ensure that only logged-in users can access the backup files.
