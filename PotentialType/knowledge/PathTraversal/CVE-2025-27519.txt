User Input Sources:  
- `upload_name`: This is a form parameter that is expected to be provided by the user. It defaults to a UUID if not specified and must match the regex pattern `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`.
- `files`: This is a list of files uploaded by the user, provided via an HTTP POST request.

Main Functionality:  
The function's primary purpose is to upload files to a specified directory within a local Docker environment. It first checks if the application is running in a local environment (`settings.LOCAL`). If not, it returns an error response. The function then attempts to create a directory with the name provided by `upload_name` in the `settings.LOCAL_DATA_DIRECTORY`. If the directory already exists, it returns an error. Otherwise, it creates the directory and saves each uploaded file into this directory. Finally, it calls an asynchronous function `add_data_source` to register the newly created directory as a data source.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- Returns a JSON response with an error message if the application is not running in a local environment or if the specified directory already exists.
- If successful, it returns the result of the `add_data_source` function, which is presumably related to the registration of the directory as a data source. The exact output of `add_data_source` is not specified but likely involves some acknowledgment of successful data source creation.
