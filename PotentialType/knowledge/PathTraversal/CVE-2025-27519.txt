The function is designed to handle file uploads in a local Docker environment. It facilitates the uploading of multiple files to a specified directory within a Docker volume. The function begins by verifying that the application is running in a local environment; if not, it returns an error response. It then logs the directory where the files will be uploaded and checks if the directory already exists, returning an error if it does. If the directory does not exist, it is created, and the files are copied into it. Finally, the function adds the directory as a data source to a metadata store and returns the result of this operation.
