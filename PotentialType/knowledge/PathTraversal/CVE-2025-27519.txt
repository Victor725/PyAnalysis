This function handles file uploads to a specified local directory within a Docker environment. It first verifies that the API is being used in a local environment. If so, it creates a unique folder in a designated local directory to store the uploaded files. The function then saves each file to this folder and registers the new data source in a metadata store. If the folder already exists, it returns an error response.
