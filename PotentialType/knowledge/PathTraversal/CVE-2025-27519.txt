This function handles the upload of files to a specified local directory within a Docker environment. It first verifies that the operation is supported only in a local environment. It then attempts to create a directory using a specified or generated name. If the directory already exists, it returns an error. Otherwise, it creates the directory and uploads the provided files into it. Finally, it updates a metadata store with information about the new data source.
