User Input Sources:  
The function takes several parameters that could potentially originate from user input:  
- `location`: A string or `PurePath` indicating the file's location, which could be specified by the user.  
- `status`: An integer representing the HTTP status code, which could be set by the user.  
- `mime_type`: A string for the MIME type of the file, which could be user-defined.  
- `headers`: A dictionary of custom headers that the user might provide.  
- `filename`: A string to override the filename, possibly provided by the user.  
- `last_modified`: A datetime object or timestamp indicating the last modified time of the file, which could be user-specified.  
- `max_age`: A float or integer for cache control, potentially set by the user.  
- `no_store`: A boolean indicating whether the response should be stored in cache, which could be user-defined.  
- `_range`: An optional `Range` object that could specify byte ranges for partial content delivery, possibly provided by the user.  

Main Functionality:  
The function is designed to create and return an HTTP response containing the data of a specified file. It reads the file from a given location on the system and supports setting various HTTP headers, including content disposition, cache control, and content range for partial content delivery. It determines the MIME type if not explicitly provided and handles cache-related headers based on `max_age` and `no_store` parameters. The function can return partial file content if a range is specified, adjusting the HTTP status code accordingly.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns an `HTTPResponse` object that includes:  
- The file's content as the body.  
- An HTTP status code, which is 206 for partial content if a range is specified, or the provided/default status otherwise.  
- A set of HTTP headers, including custom headers, cache control, content disposition, last modified, and content type.  
- The content type of the response, determined by the MIME type of the file or user specification.
