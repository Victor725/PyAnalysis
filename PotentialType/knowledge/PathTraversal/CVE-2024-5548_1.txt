User Input Sources:  
- The function takes input from the user via an HTTP POST request. The request is expected to contain JSON data, from which the function retrieves the "project_name" parameter.

Main Functionality:  
- The core purpose of the function is to delete a project based on the provided project name. It does this by first extracting the project name from the JSON data in the request. It then calls a method `delete_project` on the `manager` object to perform the deletion. Additionally, it calls the `delete_state` method on an instance of `AgentState` to remove any associated state data for the specified project.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function returns a JSON object with a message indicating the successful deletion of the project. The JSON response is structured as `{"message": "Project deleted"}`.
