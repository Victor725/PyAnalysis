The `delete_project` function handles the deletion of a project in a web application. It is triggered by a POST request to the specified API endpoint. The function extracts the project name from the incoming request's JSON payload, uses a manager to delete the specified project, and also removes associated state information. Finally, it returns a JSON response indicating successful deletion of the project.
