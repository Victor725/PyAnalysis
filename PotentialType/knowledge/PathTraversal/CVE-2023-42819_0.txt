User Input Sources:  
- The function takes an `instance` parameter, which is likely an object representing a database record or similar entity. This `instance` could originate from user input if it is retrieved based on user actions, such as HTTP request parameters, form submissions, or command-line arguments.

Main Functionality:  
- The function's primary purpose is to safely destroy an `instance` and perform cleanup operations. It first checks if the `instance` is associated with any existing jobs by evaluating `instance.job_set.exists()`. If the `instance` is currently in use (i.e., it has related jobs), it raises a `JMSException` to prevent its deletion, providing a specific error code and message. If no related jobs exist, the function proceeds to delete the `instance` by calling `super().perform_destroy(instance)`. After the `instance` is destroyed, the function constructs a file path based on the `instance` ID and removes the corresponding directory using `shutil.rmtree(dest_path)`, which is likely intended to clean up associated resources or data files.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function does not explicitly return any data. However, it may produce side effects such as raising a `JMSException` if the `instance` is in use, which would typically be handled by the calling code. If the function executes successfully without raising an exception, it results in the deletion of the specified directory, effectively cleaning up the resources associated with the `instance`.
