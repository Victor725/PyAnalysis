The function is designed to safely delete an instance, specifically ensuring that the instance is not currently associated with any active jobs before proceeding with the deletion. If the instance is linked to a job, it raises an exception to prevent deletion. Once confirmed that the instance is not in use, it performs the deletion and then removes the associated directory from the file system to clean up any residual data.
