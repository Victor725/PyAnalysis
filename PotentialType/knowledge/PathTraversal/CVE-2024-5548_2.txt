User Input Sources:  
- The function takes user input from HTTP request parameters, specifically from the query parameter `project_name` using `request.args.get("project_name")`.

Main Functionality:  
- The core purpose of the function is to handle a download request for a project. It retrieves the project name from the HTTP GET request parameters, uses this name to create a zip file of the project through the `manager.project_to_zip` method, and then obtains the path to this zip file using `manager.get_zip_path`. Finally, it prepares the file for download.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function returns a file response using `send_file`, which sends the zip file located at `project_path` back to the client. The file is not sent as an attachment, meaning it will likely be displayed in the browser or opened directly, depending on the client's configuration.
