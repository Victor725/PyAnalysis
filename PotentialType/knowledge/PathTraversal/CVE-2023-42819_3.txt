User Input Sources:  
- The function receives input through the `request` object, which likely originates from an HTTP request. Specifically, it uses `request.data.get()` to access the `key`, `is_directory`, `content`, and `name` parameters, which can be provided by the user.
- The `kwargs` dictionary is used to extract `playbook_id` through the `pk` key, which could be part of the URL or request path.

Main Functionality:  
- The function is designed to handle a POST request to create a new file or directory within a specified playbook's working directory.
- It determines the target path by combining the playbook's work directory with a `parent_key`, which is processed to ensure it is correctly formatted.
- The function checks if a directory or a file should be created based on the `is_directory` parameter. It uses a helper function `find_new_name` to generate a unique name for the new file or directory, avoiding name collisions by appending a numerical suffix if necessary.
- If `is_directory` is true, a new directory is created. Otherwise, a new file is created with the provided content.
- The function constructs a dictionary representing the new node, including its name, title, ID, parent ID, and other attributes like `isParent` and `iconSkin` for files.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function returns a JSON response containing details about the newly created file or directory. This includes the name, title, ID, parent ID, and other relevant metadata, encapsulated in a dictionary. The response is sent back using the `Response` object, which is likely part of a web framework like Django or Flask.
