This function is part of a web application that handles HTTP GET requests to retrieve files associated with a specific project. When a request is made to the specified route, the function extracts the project name from the request's query parameters. It then obtains the list of files for that project using a method from another component and returns this list in a JSON format as the response. Additionally, the function is wrapped with a decorator to log the route's activity for monitoring or debugging purposes.
