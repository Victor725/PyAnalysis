User Input Sources:  
- The function takes input from the user via HTTP GET request parameters. Specifically, it retrieves the `project_name` parameter from the query string of the request using `request.args.get("project_name")`.

Main Functionality:  
- The core purpose of the function is to handle HTTP GET requests to the `/api/get-project-files/` endpoint. It extracts the `project_name` from the request parameters and then calls the `get_project_files` method of the `AgentState` class, passing the `project_name` as an argument. This method presumably retrieves a list of files associated with the specified project.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function returns a JSON object containing a key `"files"`, which maps to the list of files retrieved for the specified project. This JSON response is sent back to the client as the output of the API call.
