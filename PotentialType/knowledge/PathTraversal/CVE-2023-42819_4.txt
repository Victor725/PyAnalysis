User Input Sources:  
- The function takes user input from the `request` object, specifically from `request.data`. The user can provide:
  - `key`: A string representing the file key.
  - `new_name`: A string for the new name of the file.
  - `content`: The content to be written to the file.
  - `is_directory`: A boolean indicating whether the path refers to a directory.
- The function also uses `kwargs` to retrieve the `playbook_id` which is used to fetch a `Playbook` object.

Main Functionality:  
- The function's core purpose is to modify files within a specific directory associated with a playbook.
- It checks if a file specified by `file_key` is protected, and if so, prevents renaming it.
- If `new_name` is provided, it attempts to rename the file specified by `file_key` to `new_name`, ensuring no conflicts with existing files.
- If `new_name` is not provided, it writes the provided `content` to the file specified by `file_key`, unless the path is a directory.
- The function ensures that file operations are performed within the directory specified by `work_path`.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function returns a `Response` object with different statuses:
  - A 400 Bad Request status if the file is protected or the new name already exists.
  - A 200 OK status if the operation (rename or edit) is successful.
- It also returns a message in JSON format if an error occurs, such as attempting to rename a protected file or if a file with the new name already exists.
