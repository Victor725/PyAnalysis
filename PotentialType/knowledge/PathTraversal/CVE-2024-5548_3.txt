User Input Sources:  
The function takes user input from an HTTP GET request parameter named `project_name`. This input is retrieved using `request.args.get("project_name")`.

Main Functionality:  
The core purpose of the function is to serve a PDF file associated with a specific project name. It constructs the path to the PDF file by combining a directory path obtained from the configuration (`Config().get_pdfs_dir()`) with the user-provided `project_name`. It then attempts to send this file as a response to the client.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns an HTTP response that includes the PDF file corresponding to the requested project name. The response has its `Content-Type` header set to 'application/pdf', indicating that the content being sent is a PDF document.
