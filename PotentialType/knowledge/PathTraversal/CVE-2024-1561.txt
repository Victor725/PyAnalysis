User Input Sources:  
The function `component_server` takes input from a POST request with a JSON body that is expected to match the `ComponentServerBody` schema. This input could originate from the user as it is part of an HTTP request.

Main Functionality:  
The function's core purpose is to handle a POST request to the endpoint `/component_server` and execute a specified function on a component block. It retrieves a session state from `app.state_holder` using a session hash provided in the request body. It then checks if a component with the given `component_id` exists in the session state. If not, it retrieves the component from a global blocks repository. The function identified by `fn_name` in the request body is then executed on the component block with the provided `data`.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns the result of executing the specified function (`fn`) on the component block. The type of data returned depends on the implementation of the function being called on the block, and it could vary widely depending on the context and logic of that function.
