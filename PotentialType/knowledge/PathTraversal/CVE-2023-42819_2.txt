This function handles a GET request to retrieve either the content of a specified file within a playbook's directory or a structured representation of the playbook's directory tree. It first attempts to find a file based on a provided key and returns its content, handling any decoding issues. If no file key is provided, it generates and returns a tree structure of the directory.
