User Input Sources:  
- The function takes input from the `request` object, specifically from `request.query_params`. It retrieves `key` and `expand` parameters, which could originate from user-provided HTTP request parameters. Additionally, it takes input from `kwargs`, extracting the `pk` value, which could also be user-provided.

Main Functionality:  
- The function's core purpose is to retrieve and return content based on a playbook's file structure. It first retrieves a playbook object using an ID from `kwargs`. If a `key` parameter is provided in the query parameters, it constructs a file path and attempts to read the file's content. If successful, it returns the content; if not, it handles a Unicode decode error by returning a message indicating unsupported file content. If no `key` is provided, the function generates a hierarchical structure (tree) of nodes related to the playbook using the `expand` parameter and returns this structure.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function returns a JSON object via a `Response` containing either the file content or a tree structure of nodes related to the playbook. If a file is read successfully, it returns `{'content': content}`. If not, it returns a JSON object with the tree structure generated by `self.generate_tree()`.
