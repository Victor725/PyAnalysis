This function is designed to handle HTTP GET requests. It retrieves a specific object based on a provided identifier, and then performs one of two actions based on query parameters:

1. If a specific file key is provided, it attempts to read the content of a file from a directory associated with the object. If the file content cannot be decoded, it returns a message indicating unsupported content. The file content or the error message is then returned in the HTTP response.

2. If no file key is provided, it generates a tree structure of nodes related to the object and returns this structure in the HTTP response.
