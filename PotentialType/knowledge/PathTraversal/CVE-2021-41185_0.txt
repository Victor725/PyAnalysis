The function `send_note_attachment` is designed to serve a file to authenticated users. When a user accesses a specific URL pattern with a filename, the function attempts to locate the corresponding file in a designated directory. If the file is found, it is sent to the user as a downloadable attachment. The function includes error handling to log any exceptions that occur during the file retrieval and delivery process.
