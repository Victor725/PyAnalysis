User Input Sources:  
- The function takes user input through the URL parameter `<filename>`. This parameter is part of the URL path in the HTTP request and can be manipulated by the user.

Main Functionality:  
- The primary purpose of the function `send_note_attachment` is to serve a file to the user from a specific directory (`PATH_NOTE_ATTACHMENTS`). It constructs the full file path using the provided `filename` parameter and attempts to send the file as an attachment using Flask's `send_file` function. The function also includes error handling to log any exceptions that occur during this process.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function returns a file as an attachment to the client. If successful, the file is sent as part of the HTTP response. If an exception occurs during file retrieval or sending, the function does not return a file but logs the exception instead.
