User Input Sources:  
- The function takes input from the user via the `request` object, specifically from `request.query_params.get('key', '')`. This is likely to be a parameter from an HTTP request.
- It also uses `kwargs.get('pk')` to retrieve the `playbook_id`, which could be passed as part of the URL or route parameters.

Main Functionality:  
- The function's core purpose is to delete a file or directory specified by the user within a particular work directory associated with a "playbook."
- It first retrieves a `Playbook` object using the `playbook_id`.
- It checks if the user-provided `file_key` is present in the query parameters. If not, it returns an error response.
- It verifies that the `file_key` is not in a list of `protected_files`. If it is, it returns an error response.
- It constructs the full file path using the playbook's work directory and the `file_key`.
- It checks if the path is a directory and deletes it using `shutil.rmtree`. If it's a file, it deletes it using `os.remove`.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function returns an HTTP response.
- If the `file_key` is missing or protected, it returns a JSON response with an error message and an HTTP 400 status code.
- Upon successful deletion of the file or directory, it returns a JSON response with a success message and a default HTTP 200 status code.
