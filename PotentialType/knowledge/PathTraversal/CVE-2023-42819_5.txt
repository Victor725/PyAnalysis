This function is responsible for handling the deletion of a file or directory within a specified working directory associated with a "playbook" object. It first retrieves the playbook based on an identifier and checks for the presence of a file key in the request parameters. If the file key is missing or refers to a protected file, it responds with an error message. Otherwise, it constructs the file path and deletes the specified file or directory, returning a success message upon completion.
