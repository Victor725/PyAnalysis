The function `file_stream` is designed to create and return a streaming response object that serves file data asynchronously. It allows for efficient file transfer by sending data in chunks, which is particularly useful for large files. The function supports specifying the file location, chunk size, MIME type, custom headers, and filename. It can also handle HTTP range requests, enabling partial content delivery, which is useful for resuming downloads or streaming media. The function constructs a response with appropriate headers and streams the file content to the client, ensuring efficient and controlled data transfer.
