User Input Sources:  
- The function takes several parameters that could originate from user input:
  - `location`: This specifies the file's location on the system and can be a string or a `PurePath` object.
  - `status`: This is the HTTP status code to return, defaulting to 200.
  - `chunk_size`: This specifies the size of each data chunk to be read from the file, with a default of 4096 bytes.
  - `mime_type`: This specifies the MIME type of the response.
  - `headers`: This allows for custom headers to be added to the response.
  - `filename`: This allows for an override of the filename in the Content-Disposition header.
  - `_range`: This is a `Range` object that specifies a byte range for partial content delivery.

Main Functionality:  
- The function's core purpose is to create an asynchronous streaming HTTP response for a file located on the server. It reads the file in chunks and streams it to the client. If a byte range is specified, it handles partial content delivery by adjusting the file pointer and reading only the specified range. It also sets appropriate HTTP headers, including `Content-Type` and `Content-Disposition`, based on provided parameters or defaults.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- The function returns a `ResponseStream` object. This object includes:
  - `streaming_fn`: An asynchronous function that streams file content in chunks.
  - `status`: An HTTP status code, either the provided one or 206 if a range is specified.
  - `headers`: A dictionary of HTTP headers for the response, including `Content-Type` and potentially `Content-Disposition` and `Content-Range`.
  - `content_type`: The MIME type of the file content, defaulting to "text/plain" if not specified.
