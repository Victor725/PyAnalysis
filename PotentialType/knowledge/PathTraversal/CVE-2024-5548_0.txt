User Input Sources:  
The function takes input from an HTTP POST request. Specifically, it expects JSON data from the request body, which is accessed through `request.json`. The JSON data should contain a key named `"project_name"`.

Main Functionality:  
The core purpose of the function is to create a new project. It extracts the `"project_name"` from the JSON data provided in the HTTP request and then calls `manager.create_project(project_name)` to perform the project creation process. The function is decorated with `@project_bp.route("/api/create-project", methods=["POST"])`, indicating that it is an endpoint for creating projects via POST requests. Additionally, it uses `@route_logger(logger)` for logging purposes, likely to log the details of the request and response for monitoring or debugging.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns a JSON response using `jsonify`, with a message indicating the successful creation of the project. The JSON response is structured as `{"message": "Project created"}`.
