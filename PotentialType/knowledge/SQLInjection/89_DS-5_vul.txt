This function handles HTTP GET requests to retrieve posts associated with a specific user from a database. It optionally filters out draft posts based on a request parameter. The function constructs and executes a SQL query to fetch the relevant posts, returning the results in JSON format. However, it is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsafe string concatenation with user input.
