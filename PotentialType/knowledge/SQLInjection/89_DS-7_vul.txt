This function handles a GET request to search for hotel rooms based on specified criteria such as room type, maximum price, and availability on a certain date. It constructs and executes a SQL query to retrieve matching room records from a database, formats the results into a JSON response, and returns them to the client. The function is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsafe query construction practices.
