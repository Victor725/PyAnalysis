This function handles HTTP GET requests to filter and retrieve employee records from a database based on a specified filter type and value. However, it is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of direct string interpolation in constructing the SQL query. If no employees match the filter, it raises a 404 error; otherwise, it returns a list of employee details. If an error occurs during execution, it raises a 400 error with the error message.
