User Input Sources:  
The function takes user input from HTTP request parameters. Specifically, it retrieves the values of `instance_name`, `db_name`, and `db_type` from the query string of the request object (`request.GET`).

Main Functionality:  
The function aims to retrieve a list of tables from a specified database. It first checks if `instance_name` and `db_name` are provided by the user. If they are, it attempts to find an `Instance` object matching the given `instance_name` and `db_type`. If the instance is found, it uses a query engine associated with that instance to get the tables from the specified database (`db_name`). The results are then formatted into a response object. If the instance is not found or another exception occurs, it returns an error message. If the required parameters are not provided, it returns an error message indicating an illegal call.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns a JSON object encapsulated in an HTTP response. The JSON object contains a status code and either the data (list of tables) or an error message. The status code is `0` for success and `1` for errors.
