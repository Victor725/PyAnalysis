The function `param_edit` is designed to handle the modification of a parameter's runtime value for a specified instance, with strict permission requirements. It begins by verifying that the user has the necessary permissions to edit parameters. The function retrieves the instance and parameter details from the request, then performs several checks: it ensures the instance exists, confirms the parameter is defined in a template, and checks if the new value differs from the current runtime value. If the new value is different, it attempts to update the parameter's value. The function handles errors that may occur during this update process and logs successful changes to a history record. The function ultimately returns a JSON response indicating the success or failure of the operation.
