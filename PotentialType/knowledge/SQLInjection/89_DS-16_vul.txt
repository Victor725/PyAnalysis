The function handles HTTP GET requests to search for user profiles based on a search term. It retrieves the search term from the request parameters, queries a database for matching user profiles based on the search term, and returns the results in JSON format. If no search term is provided, it returns an error message. Note that the function contains a security vulnerability related to SQL injection due to the way it constructs the database query.
