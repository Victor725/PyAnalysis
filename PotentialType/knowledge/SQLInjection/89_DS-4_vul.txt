The function is an API endpoint that retrieves a list of legal cases from a database based on optional search criteria such as search terms, case status, client ID, and assigned attorney. It constructs and executes a SQL query to filter cases according to these criteria and returns the matching cases. However, the function is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the way it constructs the SQL query with direct interpolation of user inputs.
