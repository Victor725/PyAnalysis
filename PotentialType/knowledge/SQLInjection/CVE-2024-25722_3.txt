The function is an asynchronous operation designed to rename a knowledge base associated with a user. It first retrieves and validates the user's identity. If the user ID is invalid, it returns an error message. Upon successful validation, it checks if the specified knowledge base exists for the user. If the knowledge base does not exist, it returns an error message indicating the absence. If it exists, the function proceeds to rename the knowledge base to the new name provided and returns a success message.
