The `PrismaClient` class is designed to manage interactions with a Prisma database. It offers methods for establishing connections, querying, and modifying database entries, while handling potential errors with retries and logging. Here's a summary of each method:

1. **`__init__`**: Initializes the client by setting up a logging object and attempting to import and configure the Prisma client. If the Prisma package is not available, it tries to install it and set up the database environment.

2. **`hash_token`**: Generates a SHA-256 hash of a given string token.

3. **`jsonify_object`**: Converts dictionary values into JSON strings if they are themselves dictionaries, effectively preparing data for database storage.

4. **`check_view_exists`**: Checks for the existence of a specific database view and creates it if it does not exist, ensuring the view is available for token and team data retrieval.

5. **`get_generic_data`**: Provides a generic method to retrieve data from specified tables based on a key-value pair, with retries and error logging.

6. **`get_data`**: Retrieves data from various tables based on different query types and parameters, with support for token-based authentication and retries.

7. **`insert_data`**: Inserts data into the database, ensuring that it doesn't duplicate existing entries. It handles various tables and prepares data accordingly.

8. **`update_data`**: Updates existing database records, either individually or in batches, based on specified conditions and data.

9. **`delete_data`**: Deletes records from the database based on provided tokens or team IDs, handling multiple entries as needed.

10. **`connect`**: Establishes a connection to the database, ensuring the client is connected before performing operations.

11. **`disconnect`**: Disconnects the client from the database.

12. **`health_check`**: Performs a basic query to verify the database's responsiveness and availability.

Overall, the `PrismaClient` class is focused on providing a robust interface for database operations, incorporating error handling, retry logic, and logging to ensure reliability and maintainability in interacting with the Prisma database.
