The `PrismaClient` class is designed to interface with a Prisma database, providing methods for managing and interacting with various tables related to users, keys, configurations, spending, teams, and user notifications. Here's a summary of each method:

1. **`__init__`**: Initializes the client by setting up logging and ensuring the Prisma client is installed and configured. It attempts to run necessary Prisma commands to set up the database environment.

2. **`hash_token`**: Generates a SHA-256 hash for a given token string.

3. **`jsonify_object`**: Converts any dictionary values within a given dictionary to JSON strings, returning a deep copy of the modified dictionary.

4. **`check_view_exists`**: Checks if a specific database view exists and creates it if not, ensuring the structure needed for token and team data retrieval is present.

5. **`get_generic_data`**: Provides a generic method to retrieve data from specified tables based on key-value conditions, employing retry logic for robustness.

6. **`get_data`**: Retrieves data from various tables based on specified parameters and query types, such as unique or multiple results, with support for token-based authentication and filtering.

7. **`insert_data`**: Inserts or upserts data into specified tables, ensuring data is added only if it doesn't already exist, with specific handling for different table types.

8. **`update_data`**: Updates existing records in the database based on provided criteria, supporting both single and batch updates across different tables.

9. **`delete_data`**: Deletes records from specified tables based on tokens or team IDs, allowing for the removal of keys or team data.

10. **`connect`**: Establishes a connection to the database if not already connected, using retry logic to handle connection failures.

11. **`disconnect`**: Closes the connection to the database, ensuring proper disconnection with error handling.

12. **`health_check`**: Performs a simple query to check the health of the database connection, confirming that the database is accessible.

Overall, the `PrismaClient` class provides a comprehensive interface for database operations with error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure reliability and resilience.
