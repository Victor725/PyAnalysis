1. **Constructor (`__init__`)**: Initializes the client by attempting to set up the Prisma environment and connect to the database using a specified URL. It also sets up a logging object.

2. **`hash_token`**: Generates a SHA-256 hash of a given token.

3. **`jsonify_object`**: Converts nested dictionaries within a data object to JSON strings.

4. **`check_view_exists`**: Checks for the existence of a specific database view and creates it if it does not exist.

5. **`get_generic_data`**: Retrieves data from specified tables based on a key-value pair and handles exceptions with retry logic.

6. **`get_data`**: Retrieves specific or multiple records from various tables based on provided parameters such as tokens, user IDs, or team IDs.

7. **`insert_data`**: Inserts new records into specified tables, using upsert logic to avoid duplication.

8. **`update_data`**: Updates existing records in specified tables, with support for batch updates and conditional updates based on various parameters.

9. **`delete_data`**: Deletes records from specified tables based on provided tokens or team IDs.

10. **`connect`**: Establishes a connection to the database if not already connected.

11. **`disconnect`**: Closes the connection to the database.

12. **`health_check`**: Performs a basic health check to verify database connectivity by executing a simple query.
