User Input Sources:
- The `__init__` method takes `database_url` and `proxy_logging_obj` as inputs, which could potentially be user-configured.
- The `hash_token` method takes a `token` string as input.
- The `jsonify_object` method takes a dictionary `data` as input.
- The `check_view_exists` method does not take direct user input but interacts with the database, which may have user-influenced data.
- The `get_generic_data` method takes `key`, `value`, and `table_name` as inputs, which could be influenced by user requests.
- The `get_data` method takes various parameters such as `token`, `user_id`, `team_id`, `key_val`, `table_name`, `query_type`, `expires`, and `reset_at`, which can originate from user input.
- The `insert_data` method takes `data` and `table_name` as inputs, likely influenced by user actions.
- The `update_data` method takes multiple parameters, including `token`, `data`, `data_list`, `user_id`, `team_id`, `query_type`, `table_name`, `update_key_values`, and `update_key_values_custom_query`, all of which could be user-influenced.
- The `delete_data` method takes `tokens`, `team_id_list`, and `table_name` as inputs, which can be user-supplied.
- The `connect` and `disconnect` methods do not take direct user input but manage the database connection, which is indirectly related to user actions.
- The `health_check` method does not take direct user input but performs a database operation.

Main Functionality:
- The `PrismaClient` class is designed to manage database operations using the Prisma ORM. It includes methods for connecting to and disconnecting from a database, handling database views, and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various tables.
- The `__init__` method initializes the Prisma client and attempts to install the Prisma package if not available.
- The `hash_token` method hashes a given token using SHA-256.
- The `jsonify_object` method converts dictionary values into JSON strings where necessary.
- The `check_view_exists` method checks for the existence of a specific database view and creates it if it does not exist.
- The `get_generic_data` method retrieves data from specified tables based on key-value pairs.
- The `get_data` method fetches data from different tables based on various parameters, supporting both unique and multiple queries.
- The `insert_data` method adds new records to specified tables, ensuring no duplicates.
- The `update_data` method updates existing records in specified tables, supporting batch updates.
- The `delete_data` method deletes records from specified tables based on provided tokens or team IDs.
- The `connect` and `disconnect` methods manage the database connection.
- The `health_check` method performs a basic database query to verify connectivity.

Outputs / Return Values:
- The `__init__` method does not return a value but sets up the Prisma client.
- The `hash_token` method returns a hashed token as a string.
- The `jsonify_object` method returns a dictionary with JSON-stringified values where applicable.
- The `check_view_exists` method returns a string indicating whether the view exists or was created.
- The `get_generic_data` method returns the response from the database query, which could be a single record or None.
- The `get_data` method returns data from the database based on the query parameters, which could be a single record or a list of records.
- The `insert_data` method returns the newly inserted or upserted record.
- The `update_data` method returns a dictionary with the updated data and associated identifiers.
- The `delete_data` method returns a dictionary indicating the deleted keys or teams.
- The `connect` and `disconnect` methods do not return values but manage the database connection.
- The `health_check` method returns the result of a database query, typically indicating success or failure of the operation.
