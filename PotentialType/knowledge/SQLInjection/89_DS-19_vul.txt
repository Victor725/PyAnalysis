This function handles a GET request to search for comments containing a specified term. It connects to a database, retrieves public comments matching the search term, and returns the results in JSON format. Note that the function contains a security vulnerability due to the use of unsanitized input in the SQL query, which makes it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
