This function handles HTTP GET requests to search for support tickets in a database based on specified query parameters such as search term, status, priority, and customer ID. It retrieves matching tickets from the database and returns them in a JSON format. However, the function is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct interpolation of user inputs into the SQL query.
