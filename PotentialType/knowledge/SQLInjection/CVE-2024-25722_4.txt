The purpose of the `delete_docs` function is to handle the deletion of specified documents associated with a user and a knowledge base in an asynchronous web application. It verifies the validity of the user ID and checks for the existence of the knowledge base and the specified files. If any validation fails, it returns an appropriate error message. If all validations pass, it proceeds to delete the files from both the knowledge base and the database, returning a success message upon completion.
