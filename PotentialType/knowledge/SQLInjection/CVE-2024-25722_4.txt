This asynchronous function is designed to handle the deletion of documents for a specific user. It verifies the user's identity and checks the existence of a specified knowledge base and files within it. If the user ID is valid and the knowledge base and files exist, the function proceeds to delete the specified files from both the knowledge base and the database, returning a success message. If any checks fail, it returns an appropriate error message.
