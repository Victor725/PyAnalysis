User Input Sources:  
The function takes user input from HTTP GET request parameters. Specifically, it retrieves values for `instance_name`, `db_name`, `tb_name`, and `db_type` from the request's query string.

Main Functionality:  
The core purpose of the function is to retrieve and provide metadata, description, and index information about a specific database table. It does this by:
1. Validating the presence of necessary parameters (`instance_name`, `db_name`, `tb_name`).
2. Fetching the database instance based on `instance_name` and `db_type`.
3. Using a query engine associated with the instance to get table metadata, description, and index data.
4. For MySQL databases, it also retrieves the SQL statement used to create the table.
5. Handling exceptions such as missing instances or other errors, and setting appropriate response messages.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns a JSON object as an HTTP response. The JSON contains:
- A `status` key indicating success (0) or failure (1).
- On success, a `data` key with detailed information about the table (metadata, description, index data, and optionally the create SQL for MySQL).
- On failure, a `msg` key with an error message.
