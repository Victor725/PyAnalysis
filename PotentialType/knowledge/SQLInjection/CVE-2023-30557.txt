The function is designed to retrieve and return metadata about a specific database table, such as its structure, description, and indexes. It requires specific permissions to be accessed and is triggered by an HTTP request containing database identifiers. The function first validates the presence of necessary parameters, then attempts to fetch the corresponding database instance. Using this instance, it gathers detailed table information via a query engine. If the database type is MySQL, it additionally retrieves the SQL statement used to create the table. The function returns a JSON response containing the collected data or an error message if the operation fails or if the request is invalid.
