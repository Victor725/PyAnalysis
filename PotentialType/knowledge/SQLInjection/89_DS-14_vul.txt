This function handles HTTP POST requests to search for users in a database based on optional username and email inputs. It constructs and executes a SQL query to retrieve matching user records, which are then rendered in an HTML template. However, the function is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of direct string concatenation for query construction.
