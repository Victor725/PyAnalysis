The function `local_doc_chat` is designed to handle an asynchronous chat interaction with a local document-based knowledge system. It validates the user ID, checks the existence of specified knowledge bases, and retrieves relevant documents. If the knowledge bases are valid and contain appropriate files, the function generates a response based on a user's query. It supports both streaming and non-streaming modes for delivering responses, potentially providing incremental updates in streaming mode. The function logs various debug information throughout the process and formats the final response to include the query, response, history, and source documents.
