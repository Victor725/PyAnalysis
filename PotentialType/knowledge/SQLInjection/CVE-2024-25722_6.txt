The `local_doc_chat` function is an asynchronous endpoint handler designed for a chatbot application that interacts with a local document-based knowledge base. It performs the following high-level tasks:

1. **User Validation**: It begins by extracting and validating a user identifier from the request. If the identifier is invalid, it returns an appropriate error message.

2. **Input Extraction**: It retrieves various parameters from the request, such as knowledge base identifiers, a user's question, a flag for reranking results, a flag for streaming responses, and the chat history.

3. **Knowledge Base Validation**: It checks the existence of the specified knowledge bases. If any are missing, it returns an error message indicating which knowledge bases are not found.

4. **Document Validation**: It gathers file information from the knowledge bases and filters out non-compliant files. If no valid files are found, it returns a message indicating the knowledge base is empty or files are not yet processed.

5. **Answer Generation**: 
   - If streaming is enabled, it generates responses in chunks asynchronously and streams them back to the client. The function continuously sends parts of the answer until the complete response is ready.
   - If streaming is not enabled, it generates the entire answer in one go and returns it as a JSON response.

6. **Logging and Response**: Throughout the process, it logs various debug information and, finally, constructs a response containing the question, the generated answer, the updated chat history, and source documents used for generating the response.
