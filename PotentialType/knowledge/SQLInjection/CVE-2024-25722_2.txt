User Input Sources: The function takes input from an HTTP request object `req`. Specifically, it retrieves the `user_id` and `kb_ids` from the request using a helper function `safe_get`. These inputs are likely to originate from user-provided data in an HTTP request, such as request parameters or JSON payload.

Main Functionality: The core purpose of the function `delete_knowledge_base` is to delete specified knowledge bases associated with a user. It first retrieves and validates the `user_id` from the request. If the `user_id` is invalid, it returns an error message. It then retrieves the `kb_ids` (knowledge base IDs) and checks if they exist for the given user using a method from `local_doc_qa.milvus_summary`. If any specified knowledge base IDs do not exist, it returns an error message. If they do exist, it proceeds to delete partitions corresponding to each `kb_id` using the `milvus` object and then deletes the knowledge bases from `local_doc_qa.milvus_summary`.

Outputs / Return Values: The function returns a JSON response using `sanic_json`. The response contains a status code and a message. If the user ID is invalid, it returns a JSON object with code `2005` and an error message. If any knowledge base IDs do not exist, it returns a JSON object with code `2003` and an error message. If the deletion is successful, it returns a JSON object with code `200` and a success message indicating the knowledge bases have been deleted.
