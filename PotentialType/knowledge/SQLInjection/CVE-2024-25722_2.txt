The function is designed to handle the deletion of specified knowledge bases associated with a user in an asynchronous web application context. It first validates the user ID extracted from the request. If the user ID is invalid, it returns an error response with a specific code and message. It then checks if the specified knowledge bases exist for the user. If any of the knowledge bases do not exist, it returns an error response indicating which ones are missing. If all specified knowledge bases exist, it proceeds to delete them by interacting with a backend system and returns a success response indicating the deletion of the knowledge bases.
