The function handles HTTP GET requests to search for products in an inventory database based on a user-provided search term. It retrieves matching products by querying the database for entries where the product name or category includes the search term. The results are then formatted as a list of product details and returned as a JSON response. However, the function contains a security vulnerability due to direct concatenation of user input into the SQL query, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
