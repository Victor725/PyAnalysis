The function `upload_weblink` is designed to handle the uploading of a web link to a document management system. It verifies the validity of the user ID and checks for the existence of the specified knowledge base ID. Depending on the upload mode, it determines whether to allow or prevent the uploading of files with the same name. If the mode is set to 'soft' and a file with the same name already exists, it returns a warning message. Otherwise, it initiates the upload process, adds the file to the system, and returns a success message indicating that the upload is in progress.
