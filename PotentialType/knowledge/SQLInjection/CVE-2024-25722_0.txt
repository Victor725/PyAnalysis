The function `upload_weblink` is designed to handle the asynchronous upload of a web link to a knowledge base system. It first verifies the validity of a user ID and ensures that the specified knowledge base ID exists. Depending on the mode specified ('soft' or 'strong'), it checks for the existence of a file with the same name and either prevents or allows the upload of duplicate files. If the file does not already exist or the mode allows for duplicates, it proceeds to add the file, creates a local file representation, and initiates an asynchronous task to insert the file into a database. The function responds with a JSON object indicating success or failure, along with relevant details about the file upload process.
