The function handles the process of uploading a web link to a document management system. It validates the user's identity and checks if the specified knowledge base exists. Depending on the mode ('soft' or 'strong'), it either prevents or allows the uploading of files with duplicate names. If the upload proceeds, it creates a new file entry and initiates an asynchronous task to insert the file into a storage system, returning a response with the upload status and related metadata.
