This asynchronous function handles the uploading of files in a web application context. It validates the user ID, checks the existence of specified knowledge base IDs, and processes the files for upload. The function supports two modes: 'soft', which prevents uploading files with duplicate names, and 'strong', which allows it. Files can either be read from local storage or received through a request. It ensures filenames are cleaned and truncated, and it interacts with a document management system to store metadata and initiate the file upload process. The function returns a JSON response indicating success or issues encountered during the upload process.
