The function is designed to handle the uploading of files in an asynchronous manner. It validates the user ID and checks the existence of a specified knowledge base ID. Depending on the mode ('soft' or 'strong'), it determines whether to allow uploading of files with the same name. It processes the files by cleaning and truncating their names, then adds them to a local document management system while updating their metadata. Finally, it initiates an asynchronous task to insert the files into a Milvus database and returns a JSON response indicating the status of the upload process.
