This function handles an HTTP GET request to search for patient records in a medical database based on optional search criteria such as first name, last name, diagnosis, and visit date range. It constructs and executes a SQL query to retrieve matching records from a database, formats the results into a JSON response, and returns it. However, the function is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of direct string interpolation in constructing the SQL query.
