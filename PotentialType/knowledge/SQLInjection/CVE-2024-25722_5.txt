The function `clean_files_by_status` is an asynchronous operation designed to manage and clean up files based on their status within a system. It validates a user ID and retrieves knowledge base identifiers associated with the user. It then checks the existence of these identifiers and proceeds to gather files with a specified status. If files are found, it deletes them from a storage system and logs the operation's details. Finally, it returns a JSON response indicating the success of the deletion process, along with the names of the deleted files.
