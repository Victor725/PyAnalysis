User Input Sources:  
The function `clean_files_by_status` takes input from an HTTP request object `req`. Specifically, it retrieves the following parameters which could originate from the user:  
- `user_id`: Retrieved using the `safe_get` function from the request.  
- `status`: Retrieved using the `safe_get` function from the request, with a default value of 'gray'.  
- `kb_ids`: Retrieved using the `safe_get` function from the request.

Main Functionality:  
The core purpose of the function is to clean (delete) files from a knowledge base based on their status for a specific user. It performs the following operations:  
1. Retrieves the `user_id` from the request and validates it. If invalid, it returns an error message.  
2. Retrieves the `status` of the files to be cleaned, defaulting to 'gray' if not specified.  
3. Retrieves `kb_ids` (knowledge base IDs) from the request. If not provided, it fetches all knowledge bases for the user.  
4. Checks if the specified knowledge bases exist. If any do not exist, it returns an error message.  
5. Retrieves files with the specified status from the knowledge bases.  
6. If there are files to delete, it deletes them from the Milvus knowledge base and the local document QA system.  
7. Returns a success message with the names of the deleted files.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns a JSON object using `sanic_json`. The possible outputs are:  
- An error message with code `2005` if the `user_id` is invalid.  
- An error message with code `2003` if any of the specified knowledge bases do not exist.  
- A success message with code `200` and the names of the deleted files if the operation is successful.
