This function collects and saves system information based on a specified category or a custom command. It validates the category type and constructs a shell command to gather relevant information, directing the output to a file. The function then executes the command and returns the file path where the information is stored. Note that there is a potential command injection vulnerability due to the way shell commands are constructed and executed.
