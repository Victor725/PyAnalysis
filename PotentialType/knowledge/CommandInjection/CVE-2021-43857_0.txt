User Input Sources:  
- The function takes input from an HTTP request object, specifically from the `request` parameter. The request can be either a GET or POST request.
- For GET requests, the `project_name` parameter is provided by the user through the URL path.
- For POST requests, the user provides input via the request body, which is expected to be a JSON object containing a `configuration` key.

Main Functionality:  
- The function serves two main purposes based on the HTTP request method:
  - For GET requests, it retrieves the configuration of a specified project by its name from the database. It converts the project's configuration from a JSON string to a Python dictionary (if it exists) and returns it as a JSON response.
  - For POST requests, it updates the configuration of a specified project. The new configuration is provided in the request body. After updating the configuration, it attempts to execute a system command to generate some resources related to the project, using the `gerapy generate` command with the sanitized project name.

Outputs / Return Values:  
- For GET requests, the function returns a JSON object containing the project's details and configuration.
- For POST requests, it returns a JSON response indicating the success or failure of the configuration update and command execution. If successful, it returns `{'status': '1'}`. If there's an error during the command execution, it returns `{'status': '0', 'message': stderr}` where `stderr` contains the error message.
