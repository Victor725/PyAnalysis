The function `project_configure` is a security-sensitive API endpoint designed to handle configuration retrieval and updates for a specific project. It performs two primary roles based on the HTTP request method:

1. **Configuration Retrieval (GET Request)**: When a GET request is received, the function retrieves the configuration details of a specified project and returns them in JSON format. It ensures that the configuration data is properly parsed before being sent in the response.

2. **Configuration Update (POST Request)**: When a POST request is received, the function updates the configuration of a specified project with the provided data. It sanitizes the project name to prevent potential command injection vulnerabilities and then executes a command to generate the project using the updated configuration. The function returns a success status in JSON format if the command executes without errors; otherwise, it returns an error message. 

The function enforces authentication, allowing only authenticated users to access its functionality.
