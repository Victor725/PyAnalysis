The function is designed to handle the configuration of a project based on HTTP request methods. For a GET request, it retrieves and returns the project's configuration in JSON format. For a POST request, it updates the project's configuration with new data provided in the request, sanitizes the project name for security, and executes a command to generate project-related resources. It returns a JSON response indicating success or failure based on the command execution outcome.
