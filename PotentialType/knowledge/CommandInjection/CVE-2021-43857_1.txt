The function handles HTTP POST requests to clone a project from a GitHub repository. It verifies that the provided address is a valid URL, appends '.git' if necessary, and executes a git clone command to download the repository into a specified directory. It logs the command execution and returns a JSON response indicating the success or failure of the cloning process based on the presence of errors. The function is secured to only allow access to authenticated users.
