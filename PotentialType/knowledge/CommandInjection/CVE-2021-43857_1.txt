User Input Sources:  
The function takes input from the user through an HTTP POST request. The input is expected to be in JSON format and is accessed via `request.body`. The specific user-provided data extracted from this input is the 'address', which is a URL indicating the location of a Git repository.

Main Functionality:  
The core purpose of the function is to clone a Git repository from a specified address provided by the user. The function first checks if the request method is POST. It then parses the JSON body of the request to retrieve the 'address'. The function ensures that the 'address' starts with 'http' to validate it as a URL. If it does not end with '.git', the function appends '.git' to the address. It then constructs a shell command to clone the repository into a target directory within a predefined `PROJECTS_FOLDER`. The cloning process is executed using the `Popen` method, which runs the command in a subprocess. The function logs the command and the results of its execution, including any errors encountered.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns a JSON response. If the cloning process completes without errors, it returns `{'status': True}`. If there is an error during the cloning process (indicated by the presence of stderr output), it returns `{'status': False}`. The function also logs debug information and errors related to the cloning process.
