The function attempts to convert a file from its current format to a specified output format using a command-line tool. It first checks if the requested format is supported and if the input file exists. If these checks pass, it constructs a command to perform the conversion and executes it. It then verifies whether the conversion was successful by checking for the existence of the output file. If successful, it returns the path to the converted file; otherwise, it returns `None`. The function also handles errors and prints relevant messages to the standard error stream. Notably, the function is vulnerable to command injection due to the way it constructs and executes the command.
