The function is designed to convert a file from its current format to a specified output format, saving the result in a designated output directory. It checks if the requested format is supported and verifies the existence of the input file. If the conversion is successful, it returns the path to the converted file; otherwise, it returns `None` and provides error messages for unsupported formats, missing input files, or conversion failures.
