The function is designed to perform a system check based on a specified type, executing a corresponding command to gather system information (such as CPU, memory, disk, or network status) and log the results to a file. If a custom check type is specified, it executes a custom command provided by the user. The function logs the output to a designated file and returns the file's path.
