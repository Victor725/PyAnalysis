This function performs a system check based on a specified type and logs the results to a file. It supports predefined check types for CPU, memory, disk, and network, executing corresponding system commands. If a custom type is specified, it executes a user-provided command. The function logs the output of the executed command to a file and returns the file path. Note: The function contains a command injection vulnerability due to the use of shell=True in subprocess execution.
