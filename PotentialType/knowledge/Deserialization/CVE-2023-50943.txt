The function `get_xcom_entry` is designed to retrieve an XCom entry from a database within an Apache Airflow environment. It performs access control checks to ensure the caller has the necessary permissions to access the requested data. The function supports both serialized and deserialized retrieval of XCom values, depending on a configuration setting and a parameter. If deserialization is requested and enabled, the function will deserialize the XCom value before returning it. The function raises an error if the requested XCom entry is not found or if deserialization is attempted when it is disabled in the configuration. Ultimately, it returns the retrieved XCom entry in a serialized format suitable for API responses.
