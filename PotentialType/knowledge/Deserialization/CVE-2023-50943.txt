User Input Sources:  
The function `get_xcom_entry` takes several parameters that could originate from user input, such as HTTP request parameters. These parameters include `dag_id`, `task_id`, `dag_run_id`, `xcom_key`, `map_index`, and `deserialize`. These inputs determine which XCom entry is queried from the database.

Main Functionality:  
The core purpose of the `get_xcom_entry` function is to retrieve an XCom entry from a database. The function constructs a SQL query to find the XCom entry based on the specified `dag_id`, `task_id`, `dag_run_id`, `xcom_key`, and `map_index`. It also checks if deserialization is enabled in the configuration when `deserialize` is set to `True`. If deserialization is required and supported, it deserializes the XCom value before returning it. The function raises exceptions if deserialization is not enabled when requested or if the XCom entry is not found.

Outputs / Return Values:  
The function returns an `APIResponse` containing the serialized data of the XCom entry. If deserialization is requested and enabled, the function returns the deserialized XCom value. If the XCom entry is not found, it raises a `NotFound` exception, and if deserialization is requested but not enabled, it raises a `BadRequest` exception.
