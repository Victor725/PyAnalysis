The function `get_xcom_entry` retrieves an XCom entry from a database based on specified identifiers such as DAG ID, task ID, DAG run ID, XCom key, and map index. It can optionally deserialize the XCom value if deserialization is enabled in the configuration. If the entry is found, it is returned as an API response; otherwise, a "not found" error is raised.
