The function handles HTTP POST requests for a server. It processes configuration uploads and event recordings by checking the request path. If the path is '/upload_config', it attempts to process and upload configuration data, responding with success or failure messages. If the path is '/record', it tries to record event data, again responding with success or failure messages. For any other path, it responds with a not found error.
