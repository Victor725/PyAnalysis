It facilitates operations related to registered models and model versions, including creating, updating, renaming, deleting, and searching for registered models and model versions. The class also supports setting and deleting tags and aliases for both registered models and model versions. Additionally, it includes methods for managing prompt-related operations such as creating, searching, deleting prompts, and linking prompt versions to models, traces, and runs within Unity Catalog. The class handles various aspects of model version management, including uploading model artifacts, handling temporary credentials, and managing model version dependencies.",
